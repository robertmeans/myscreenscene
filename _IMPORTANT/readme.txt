These 2 files must reside in the root of the hosting directory. At the time of typing this, myscreenscene.com is hosted through robertmeans.com and resides in a subdirectory of robertmeans.com. These 3 files are in the root of robertmeans.com.

I have included phpinfo.php in this folder just in case you need to run it to see details of current php configuration.

Current environment:
OS: Linux
PHP 5.3.24
MySQL 5.0
